An end-to-end workforce analytics project combining Python-based statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and an interactive Tableau dashboard to uncover drivers of employee turnover and support strategic HR decision-making.

---

## 📌 Background  
Employee turnover poses a significant challenge for organizations, impacting productivity, team morale, and long-term financial performance. This project analyzes an anonymized employee dataset containing key workforce attributes, enabling the exploration of attrition patterns and the development of data-driven insights to support proactive workforce planning.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This project conducts a comprehensive employee attrition analysis by examining demographic characteristics, employment history, compensation details, performance indicators, and job satisfaction metrics.

### **Key Objectives**
- Uncover key drivers of attrition  
- Identify patterns across roles, departments, and demographics  
- Explore predictive techniques to estimate attrition risk  
- Present insights through an interactive dashboard for stakeholders  

---

## 🧠 Executive Summary  

### 🔹 Key Drivers of Attrition
- Job satisfaction and work environment indicators show strong correlation with turnover.  
- Lower salary bands and shorter tenure increase attrition likelihood.  
- Certain roles/departments display disproportionately higher attrition risks.  

### 🔹 Workforce Patterns
- Mid-career employees show elevated turnover.  
- Attrition clusters around roles with high workload-to-reward imbalance.  
- Satisfaction and performance metrics provide predictive value.  

### 🔹 Predictive Modeling
A classification model was developed to estimate attrition probability.  
Model insights highlight high-risk segments suitable for targeted retention strategies.

### 🔹 Recommended Actions
- Prioritize interventions for high-turnover roles.  
- Adjust compensation bands and career paths for lower-pay groups.  
- Leverage modeling to identify rising-risk employees earlier.  
- Improve satisfaction drivers (manager quality, advancement opportunities).

## 🛠️ Methodology  

### **1. Data Preparation**
- Cleaned and validated employee records  
- Handled missing values and inconsistent entries  
- Engineered tenure, compensation groups, and satisfaction indicators  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**
- Summary statistics and distribution checks  
- Correlation heatmaps and feature interactions  
- Attrition rate calculations by role and department  
- Workforce segmentation exploration  

### **3. Predictive Modeling**
- Trained and evaluated classification models (Logistic Regression, Tree-based)  
- Measured accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix  
- Identified feature importance to understand influencing factors  

### **4. Visualization & Storytelling (Tableau)**
- Created interactive dashboard for business stakeholders  
- Designed filters for dept, salary, satisfaction, tenure  
- Translated technical findings into strategic insights

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset includes anonymized employee records with fields such as:

- Demographics  
- Tenure  
- Job role and department  
- Compensation  
- Satisfaction metrics  
- Performance indicators  
- Attrition label  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations  
- Dataset may not capture all complexities of real HRIS data.  
- Self-reported satisfaction metrics introduce subjective bias.  
- Insights should be interpreted directionally.  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- Survival analysis for time-to-attrition modeling  
- Add promotion/compensation history  
- Deploy predictive model through a simple web app  
- Departmental benchmarking and deeper segmentation
